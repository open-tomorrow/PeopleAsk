# Why PeopleAsk

During a meet, Giuseppe Baccini and Francesco Torchia had a chat about
the best way for increasing their respective frontend and backend skills.
They agreed that working on a shared project could be the best option.

Working on a project that could be useful for people increased
their motivation, hence the idea of PeopleAsk.

## Context and Problem Statement

PeopleAsk aims to provide a template platform for issuing public petitions.
The main focus for this project is to empower people with a platform that has
at its very core the ability to strongly authenticate signers.

Implementing a strong authentication gives a potential legal value to the
outcome of a petition and thus empowers organizers to submit petitions
to governments without them being able to ignore them.

Moreover, a foundation statement for PeopleAsk is to be a completely
available solution for everyone who may want to use it without any restrictions.
This implies that Motivations, architecture, design, decisions,
code and documentation must be open and public.

So, to recap:

- We want to develop a petition platform that can produce an usable outcome.
- We want it to be deployable in a trusted environment owned by organizers.
- We want it to be reliable, secure and easy for both organizers and signers.
- We want it to be built with the best open sources technologies available
today.

## Considered Options

### Don't do it

Nowadays, in the public space, there are a lot of solutions that allow
to do petitions with just one click.

The main problem with these solutions is that they all are requiring
just an email to sign a petition.
Under this conditions, a petition simply has no weight when presented to
governments.

### Do it

Nowadays, there isn't a petition platform with a strong authentication
system for signers that is freely available.

## Decision Outcome

We will develop PeopleAsk.
